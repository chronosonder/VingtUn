Pontoon (2011)

The rules of modern Pontoon vary widely. Those below are based on a description by Arnold of the standard rules. All is as in the 1939 rules except as follows.[9]

The first player to draw a Jack becomes the dealer or banker. Players place stakes of any value between the agreed lower and upper limits after looking at their first card. The banker may not look at his or her own cards or double the stakes. Any player who holds a pontoon (Ace and 10-point card) on being dealt a second card, declares it immediately and places it on the table.

As before, the banker then asks each player in turn what they wish to do: stand or 'stick', buy or twist. A player may not stand on a score of lower than 16. A player may buy up to 5 cards, which beats everything except a pontoon. A player may not buy a fifth card unless already holding at least 12 points, but may, however, twist. Players do not pay for twisted cards, but may not buy after having twisted. Players who have busted, lose their stake and pass their cards to the banker who places them face down under the pack. Players do not show their cards during this process. Players may only split if they have two (or more) Aces.

Having gone around all the players, the banker now exposes his or her two cards. If they make a pontoon, the dealer claims all remaining stakes, even from players with a pontoon themselves. Otherwise the dealer may stand or deal himself more cards, but may not split. If the dealer has a five-card hand, this beats all other hands except a pontoon. The banker wins all ties. If busted, the dealer pays all those still in the game. A player with a pontoon is paid double, unless it is part of a split hand. The banker is not paid double for a pontoon.

A player who beats the banker with a pontoon, may take over the deal if desired. If two or more players have a pontoon, positional priority applies.
